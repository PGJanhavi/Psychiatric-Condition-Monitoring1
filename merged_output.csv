384.158,392.208,8.050000000000011,Participant,i think it's just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they they're very inspiring and
393.298,402.478,9.180000000000007,Participant,which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't
403.148,409.858,6.7099999999999795,Participant,it's sometimes hard to find someone who's gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so
410.938,416.708,5.770000000000039,Participant,i don't really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there
420.078,436.018,15.939999999999998,Participant,you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently
436.528,443.208,6.680000000000007,Participant,instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time
451.948,455.628,3.680000000000007,Participant,um i guess it depends on who you talk to
457.888,463.068,5.180000000000007,Participant,i'm i'm okay at it i could probably work at that
464.048,464.648,0.6000000000000227,Participant,um
465.538,469.728,4.189999999999998,Participant,i don't know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it
473.298,484.118,10.819999999999993,Participant,well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me
484.988,489.698,4.7099999999999795,Participant,but i don't know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress
490.438,495.248,4.810000000000002,Participant,lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better
504.238,504.628,0.38999999999998636,Participant,no
508.218,508.618,0.39999999999997726,Participant,no
511.298,511.628,0.3299999999999841,Participant,no
518.208,519.448,1.240000000000009,Participant,um
520.658,521.578,0.9199999999999591,Participant,nothing major
522.448,533.018,10.57000000000005,Participant,i mean maybe when i was younger i could've traveled more or i could've worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean
533.708,540.138,6.430000000000064,Participant,those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda would've done but you know
541.278,552.838,11.559999999999945,Participant,but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could've become a banker or i could've become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but
553.538,559.818,6.279999999999973,Participant,but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine so so i'm it wasn't meant to be so
563.948,564.398,0.4500000000000455,Participant,yeah
565.218,565.468,0.25,Participant,so
567.718,568.748,1.0300000000000864,Participant,um i think
569.918,570.658,0.7400000000000091,Participant,i think my
571.488,573.608,2.119999999999891,Participant,in my life i knew that
574.368,590.858,16.489999999999895,Participant,i there's a lot of things i have <ha> there's more dislikes <laughter> than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with
591.348,595.318,3.9700000000000273,Participant,so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of
596.498,598.648,2.1499999999999773,Participant,mmm kind of answered itself so
602.078,616.388,14.31000000000006,Participant,no it i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it it's kind of a good thing 'cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense
616.738,631.878,15.139999999999986,Participant,it's like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not gonna go in so sometimes it's just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you
642.398,646.818,4.419999999999959,Participant,memorable experiences um hmm
650.488,665.948,15.459999999999923,Participant,i think it's just i don't really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from getting it just just the fact that
667.058,679.768,12.710000000000036,Participant,i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able
680.588,688.298,7.710000000000036,Participant,i'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like
689.468,690.498,1.0300000000000864,Participant,i've gotten somewhere
691.628,700.358,8.729999999999905,Participant,maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire
704.798,705.218,0.4199999999999591,Participant,yeah
714.098,715.168,1.07000000000005,Participant,um

722.488,725.798,3.3099999999999454,Participant,i don't know i'm not really someone who's like
727.038,732.338,5.2999999999999545,Participant,i don't have any real high highs or low lows i mean i haven't hit any lows so i mean i
733.908,742.868,8.960000000000036,Participant,i don't know i'm usually pretty i feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty happy <ha> every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then i'm pretty happy so
743.548,745.318,1.7699999999999818,Participant,i guess to answer the question probably
746.718,753.888,7.170000000000073,Participant,mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if i'm able to accomplish something then then hey i'm happy
760.978,766.638,5.660000000000082,Participant,i don't know i don't really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends

192.68,202.2,9.519999999999982,Participant,the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know
203.19,204.49,1.3000000000000114,Participant,he's the first one who taught me that
205.83,208.49,2.6599999999999966,Participant,school was not about a grade but about learning

416.17,422.4,6.229999999999961,Participant,it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think
422.97,431.42,8.449999999999989,Participant,and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway

490.37,497.08,6.7099999999999795,Participant,you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics
497.78,498.27,0.4900000000000091,Participant,and
498.85,502.37,3.519999999999982,Participant,you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it

507.37,519.27,11.899999999999977,Participant,as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid
525.83,526.18,0.34999999999990905,Participant,okay

287.72,292.77,5.0499999999999545,Participant,probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda

337.77,344.63,6.860000000000014,Participant,because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's
344.99,353.24,8.25,Participant,all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the

394.46,403.28,8.819999999999993,Participant,lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep
403.71,414.29,10.580000000000041,Participant,or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me  
417.84,429.07,11.230000000000018,Participant,i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function

488.83,492.03,3.1999999999999886,Participant,of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to
492.75,493.21,0.45999999999997954,Participant,kind of
494.26,502.92,8.660000000000025,Participant,just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more

596.81,602.74,5.930000000000064,Participant,exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and
603.25,614.31,11.059999999999945,Participant,i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and
614.54,626.33,11.790000000000077,Participant,i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles 
630.33,642.72,12.389999999999986,Participant,oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so

667.43,676.92,9.490000000000009,Participant,i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just
677.47,681.79,4.319999999999936,Participant,tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do 
688.65,689.37,0.7200000000000273,Participant,oh

229.737,232.732,2.9950000000000045,Participant,things i don't like about l_a or say california in general
233.032,234.582,1.549999999999983,Participant,say like the high tax rate
235.152,239.912,4.760000000000019,Participant,which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now
240.167,243.157,2.990000000000009,Participant,which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations
243.317,244.787,1.4699999999999989,Participant,i'm a small business owner
245.327,256.142,10.814999999999998,Participant,so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated
256.76,259.99,3.230000000000018,Participant,and uh that's a big problem here in uh
260.25,262.16,1.910000000000025,Participant,uh california
263.485,267.21,3.724999999999966,Participant,it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh
267.96,269.06,1.1000000000000227,Participant,also uh
270.315,276.67,6.355000000000018,Participant,you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't
277.127,280.937,3.8100000000000023,Participant,see that but it's a big tax on the social service system
281.337,283.107,1.7700000000000387,Participant,and that's what makes our taxes
283.507,287.477,3.9699999999999704,Participant,uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of
288.627,289.447,0.8199999999999932,Participant,so that's
290.092,300.099,10.007000000000005,Participant,you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state

354.564,357.004,2.4399999999999977,Participant,'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up
357.859,361.439,3.580000000000041,Participant,and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga
361.704,364.174,2.4699999999999704,Participant,and work out and uh

373.499,383.219,9.71999999999997,Participant,um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span
383.501,391.191,7.689999999999998,Participant,but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times
391.511,395.571,4.060000000000002,Participant,we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local

398.661,401.151,2.490000000000009,Participant,cooked and did our own shopping but really
401.566,404.896,3.330000000000041,Participant,having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days
405.296,410.561,5.264999999999986,Participant,it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city
410.861,414.461,3.6000000000000227,Participant,and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french
414.826,419.711,4.884999999999991,Participant,which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger
419.956,422.446,2.490000000000009,Participant,my mother insisted that all of us kids
422.656,427.886,5.230000000000018,Participant,take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh
428.716,433.256,4.539999999999964,Participant,all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school
434.126,439.326,5.2000000000000455,Participant,so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french
439.486,440.486,1.0,Participant,with the french
440.721,446.106,5.384999999999991,Participant,you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me
447.666,449.801,2.134999999999991,Participant,<laughter> so that was a

477.276,478.386,1.1100000000000136,Participant,interesting
478.796,479.996,1.1999999999999886,Participant,and uh
480.901,482.601,1.6999999999999886,Participant,it was something that i wanted to do
482.736,486.921,4.185000000000002,Participant,where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports
487.301,491.766,4.465000000000032,Participant,and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland
492.231,494.271,2.0400000000000205,Participant,and i originally wanted to be a doctor but
494.716,496.416,1.6999999999999886,Participant,once you start going to school
496.641,498.731,2.089999999999975,Participant,for a little bit you change your mind
499.101,500.381,1.2799999999999727,Participant,etcetera so
504.686,508.986,4.300000000000011,Participant,um i'm actually in the wholesale business now
509.486,512.751,3.2649999999999864,Participant,for wholesale distributors of furniture products
513.566,517.276,3.7099999999999227,Participant,and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago
517.56,522.895,5.335000000000036,Participant,well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business
523.15,524.57,1.4200000000000728,Participant,and it's
525.095,527.825,2.730000000000018,Participant,pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it
528.175,530.635,2.4600000000000364,Participant,but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past
533.83,534.47,0.6399999999999864,Participant,hm
534.875,542.18,7.30499999999995,Participant,actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home
542.705,544.125,1.419999999999959,Participant,and uh
545.14,545.98,0.8400000000000318,Participant,uh
546.665,551.315,4.650000000000091,Participant,i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter
551.99,553.2,1.2100000000000364,Participant,and uh
553.955,557.735,3.7799999999999727,Participant,you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked
558.32,566.85,8.529999999999973,Participant,but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids
567.25,575.34,8.090000000000032,Participant,you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life
575.54,576.04,0.5,Participant,so
576.5,579.23,2.730000000000018,Participant,probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun
585.72,591.42,5.699999999999932,Participant,uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers
591.84,594.65,2.8099999999999454,Participant,but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable
595.25,597.68,2.42999999999995,Participant,i think i'm more of an extrovert
598.28,601.29,3.009999999999991,Participant,whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted
601.48,612.68,11.199999999999932,Participant,but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation
613.84,616.61,2.769999999999982,Participant,and be more um
617.29,618.32,1.0300000000000864,Participant,introverted
618.89,627.025,8.134999999999991,Participant,i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved
643.152,646.072,2.919999999999959,Participant,oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh
646.587,649.412,2.8250000000000455,Participant,one of my i have uh several computers at home
649.972,653.222,3.25,Participant,and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well
653.752,667.922,14.170000000000073,Participant,i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach
668.457,673.082,4.625,Participant,you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes
674.012,677.737,3.7250000000000227,Participant,it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years
678.302,679.182,0.8799999999999955,Participant,i had
679.707,680.477,0.7699999999999818,Participant,it uh
681.217,684.827,3.6100000000000136,Participant,i usually find exercise helps me relax the best
685.107,689.287,4.180000000000064,Participant,or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter>
690.952,695.895,4.942999999999984,Participant,but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but
698.215,699.945,1.7300000000000182,Participant,yes that was uh
700.235,701.165,0.92999999999995,Participant,that was it but
701.515,706.535,5.019999999999982,Participant,that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills
706.7,709.54,2.839999999999918,Participant,i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years
710.01,711.8,1.7899999999999636,Participant,i think i've gotten better
712.53,713.905,1.375,Participant,uh at the
714.74,717.28,2.5399999999999636,Participant,i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature
717.795,720.615,2.82000000000005,Participant,as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and
721.165,722.295,1.1299999999999955,Participant,be a little more
722.815,724.925,2.1099999999999,Participant,how do you had had the skills earlier
729.965,734.38,4.414999999999964,Participant,i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged
734.99,736.06,1.0699999999999363,Participant,um
736.45,737.41,0.9599999999999227,Participant,you know i
738.235,742.355,4.1200000000000045,Participant,i am more likely to think before i speak now
742.58,746.44,3.8600000000000136,Participant,whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought
747.115,749.245,2.1299999999999955,Participant,so i might've said more things that i
750.105,753.775,3.669999999999959,Participant,in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or
754.3,755.75,1.4500000000000455,Participant,a work situation
756.48,757.45,0.9700000000000273,Participant,um
757.75,765.025,7.274999999999977,Participant,but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it
765.31,769.72,4.410000000000082,Participant,i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties
771.34,775.42,4.079999999999927,Participant,so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity
779.83,780.85,1.0199999999999818,Participant,oh wow
781.275,786.595,5.32000000000005,Participant,you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional
787.64,789.53,1.8899999999999864,Participant,argument um
790.26,791.33,1.07000000000005,Participant,probably
792.39,793.28,0.8899999999999864,Participant,um
793.67,798.62,4.9500000000000455,Participant,my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter
799.12,801.55,2.42999999999995,Participant,and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just
801.7,806.885,5.184999999999945,Participant,basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting
807.71,809.31,1.599999999999909,Participant,and uh just
810.155,813.415,3.259999999999991,Participant,uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused
813.84,817.03,3.189999999999941,Participant,us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument
817.44,821.755,4.314999999999941,Participant,but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree
822.28,823.15,0.8700000000000045,Participant,butt heads
823.37,823.89,0.5199999999999818,Participant,so
827.705,829.785,2.0799999999999272,Participant,i felt like i was talking to a wall
830.26,833.33,3.07000000000005,Participant,and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've
833.99,840.06,6.069999999999936,Participant,learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should
840.815,844.065,3.25,Participant,usually have but you're not really thinking of that because
844.44,845.74,1.2999999999999545,Participant,sometimes when we're younger we're
846.285,850.445,4.160000000000082,Participant,looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me
850.885,852.085,1.2000000000000455,Participant,but you know
852.48,854.37,1.8899999999999864,Participant,i'm pretty easy going and i have
854.92,855.55,0.6299999999999955,Participant,different
855.91,858.13,2.2200000000000273,Participant,ideas on raising children how she did
858.375,859.455,1.080000000000041,Participant,and that was more
859.79,867.445,7.655000000000086,Participant,not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really
868.152,871.182,3.0299999999999727,Participant,discussed those things but it was really just fundamental
871.512,874.967,3.455000000000041,Participant,reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match
875.427,877.227,1.7999999999999545,Participant,whereas other things looked good
877.902,879.942,2.0399999999999636,Participant,you know on paper to both of us
888.647,889.237,0.5899999999999181,Participant,hm
895.467,899.482,4.014999999999986,Participant,there's one recently my father passed away uh recently
900.897,901.687,0.7899999999999636,Participant,thank you
901.997,903.437,1.4400000000000546,Participant,and
904.582,911.062,6.480000000000018,Participant,really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days
911.447,915.677,4.230000000000018,Participant,and i really only invited very very close friends and family members
916.087,920.627,4.539999999999964,Participant,i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of
921.312,924.827,3.5149999999999864,Participant,not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a
925.897,929.547,3.6499999999999773,Participant,i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact
929.887,934.287,4.400000000000091,Participant,that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known
934.607,940.092,5.485000000000014,Participant,about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but
940.509,942.749,2.240000000000009,Participant,now as time's passed i wish i'd invited
943.244,947.154,3.909999999999968,Participant,more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends
947.474,952.804,5.329999999999927,Participant,you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just
953.344,958.259,4.914999999999964,Participant,and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because
958.634,964.909,6.274999999999977,Participant,i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but
965.246,968.411,3.1649999999999636,Participant,i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little

909.56,915.11,5.550000000000068,Participant,i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh
916,921.91,5.909999999999968,Participant,it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um
922.95,929.84,6.889999999999986,Participant,i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh

739.92,740.73,0.8100000000000591,Participant,and
741.66,748.13,6.470000000000027,Participant,with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild

750.77,755.79,5.019999999999982,Participant,and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes

1030.35,1037.96,7.610000000000127,Participant,i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know

445.28,452.64,7.360000000000014,Participant,but i think that's one thing that i that i've tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kinda regret not doing just being just being nice
453.78,454.14,0.36000000000001364,Participant,<clears throat>
458.96,461.98,3.0200000000000387,Participant,hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty recent
462.48,467.56,5.079999999999984,Participant,kinda tough because uh i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and he recently got
468.12,470.83,2.7099999999999795,Participant,diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough

476.86,483.5,6.639999999999986,Participant,so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't wanna do that but at the same time i don't know his tendencies
483.91,485.23,1.3199999999999932,Participant,he could be a little you know

853.997,862.417,8.420000000000073,Participant,like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like
862.9,866.051,3.1510000000000673,Participant,complexity of character within the movie
866.54,867.84,1.3000000000000682,Participant,and um
868.96,870.131,1.1709999999999354,Participant,that somehow like
871.37,872.961,1.5910000000000082,Participant,<sigh> um
874.6,878.281,3.6809999999999263,Participant,what what were they saying they were saying like the movie
883.47,886.05,2.5799999999999272,Participant,it like xxx it's like the end of an era
886.471,894.25,7.778999999999996,Participant,which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they
894.66,896.43,1.7699999999999818,Participant,how they interact in the plot
896.79,897.551,0.761000000000081,Participant,um
898.04,899.021,0.9809999999999945,Participant,kind of like

904.75,911.54,6.789999999999964,Participant,i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's
912.05,913.081,1.0310000000000628,Participant,the um
913.89,918.46,4.57000000000005,Participant,i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i
918.971,926.78,7.808999999999969,Participant,i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like
927.43,930.15,2.7200000000000273,Participant,in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it
930.571,939.89,9.31899999999996,Participant,um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool
940.29,940.821,0.5310000000000628,Participant,um
941.36,945.46,4.100000000000023,Participant,the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but
945.98,954.55,8.569999999999936,Participant,but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained
954.82,957.22,2.3999999999999773,Participant,and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie
957.65,961.6,3.9500000000000455,Participant,and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like
962.03,964.071,2.0410000000000537,Participant,so in the movie django unchained
964.44,972.371,7.930999999999926,Participant,um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big
972.991,973.131,0.13999999999998636,Participant,the
973.64,975.25,1.6100000000000136,Participant,big purpose of the movie is
975.73,976.481,0.7509999999999764,Participant,and um
977.28,979.49,2.2100000000000364,Participant,and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh
979.93,985.46,5.530000000000086,Participant,who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he
986.04,993.64,7.600000000000023,Participant,was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django
994.01,1003.65,9.639999999999986,Participant,or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera
1004.15,1004.871,0.7210000000000036,Participant,and um
1005.44,1018.151,12.710999999999899,Participant,and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not
1018.651,1021.48,2.8290000000000646,Participant,sacrifice themself for someone else
1022.06,1025.52,3.4600000000000364,Participant,um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like
1026.021,1026.541,0.5199999999999818,Participant,um
1028.28,1029.01,0.7300000000000182,Participant,like who
1029.42,1031.64,2.2200000000000273,Participant,uh like
1032.48,1034.57,2.089999999999918,Participant,she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that
1035.07,1040.51,5.440000000000055,Participant,altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist
1040.83,1047.56,6.730000000000018,Participant,um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself
1047.941,1055.18,7.239000000000033,Participant,um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like
1055.651,1068.041,12.389999999999873,Participant,every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor
1068.45,1075.27,6.819999999999936,Participant,in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um
1076.92,1083.8,6.879999999999882,Participant,purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate
1084.14,1084.941,0.8009999999999309,Participant,um
1085.37,1086.271,0.9010000000000673,Participant,and uh
1087.111,1089.631,2.519999999999982,Participant,somewhat like yeah and it's it uh
1090.761,1099,8.239000000000033,Participant,so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um
1099.38,1101.63,2.25,Participant,i think of losing my temper as being more
1103.8,1104.441,0.6410000000000764,Participant,um
1105.84,1106.39,0.5500000000001819,Participant,like i just

1117.351,1122.778,5.426999999999907,Participant,maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like
1123.19,1124.108,0.9179999999998927,Participant,well you're an idiot

1083.48,1092.41,8.930000000000064,Participant,he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they

1112.05,1118.13,6.080000000000155,Participant,and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do
1118.66,1120.03,1.3699999999998909,Participant,uh i don't miss them but
1120.77,1126.01,5.240000000000009,Participant,if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made

1167.65,1173.34,5.689999999999827,Participant,i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but
1173.96,1176.22,2.259999999999991,Participant,i just don't feel the motivation no more
1176.51,1181.63,5.120000000000118,Participant,i wish i had a pocket of money and i'd have somebody else to it that's how i feel <laughter>

39.775,40.13,0.355000000000004,Participant,okay
46.52,47.2,0.6799999999999997,Participant,yes i am
52.66,53.78,1.1200000000000045,Participant,i'm good thank you
55.285,55.595,0.3100000000000023,Participant,<laughter>
58.21,61.46,3.25,Participant,originally from los angeles and my parents are from central america
63.83,64.2,0.37000000000000455,Participant,yes
67.01,75.58,8.569999999999993,Participant,the weather um i like that i can get to the water if i want to uh to the hills or hike or just any element that i wanna get to i can get to
80.41,84.83,4.420000000000002,Participant,traffic <laughter> busyness everybody's always in a hurry um
85.33,86.11,0.7800000000000011,Participant,um that's about it
93.06,93.38,0.3199999999999932,Participant,<laughter>
95.58,99.27,3.6899999999999977,Participant,when i can i have family in central america and when i can my husband and i we try to
99.72,102.85,3.1299999999999955,Participant,go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean
106.9,116.57,9.669999999999987,Participant,the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about <laughter>
120.05,123.6,3.549999999999997,Participant,um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from
124.2,128.87,4.670000000000002,Participant,so it was sort of like a it's it's a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home
129.25,135.47,6.219999999999999,Participant,so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom
135.88,139.38,3.5,Participant,and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way
144.68,147.02,2.3400000000000034,Participant,experiences on vacation or
148.79,151.33,2.5400000000000205,Participant,um most memorable experience
152.21,156.01,3.799999999999983,Participant,probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food i'm a foodie so
156.35,165.37,9.02000000000001,Participant,having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just i've never been able to taste it that way any time else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me 'cause
165.945,168.875,2.930000000000007,Participant,no matter what i do to my pork it'll never taste like that pork in lahaina <laughter>
175.45,179.06,3.6100000000000136,Participant,business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field
179.56,183.05,3.490000000000009,Participant,so i've enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field
187.07,188.05,0.9800000000000182,Participant,my dream job
188.595,189.125,0.5300000000000011,Participant,hmm
191.12,193.49,2.3700000000000045,Participant,well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook
193.96,199.22,5.259999999999991,Participant,and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family
199.58,207.95,8.369999999999976,Participant,if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now
208.37,215.51,7.139999999999986,Participant,but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job
221.49,222.21,0.7199999999999989,Participant,i'm outgoing
228.28,229.04,0.7599999999999909,Participant,<laughter>
232.56,234.22,1.6599999999999966,Participant,<laughter> that's cool <laughter>
235.34,242.86,7.52000000000001,Participant,uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at
243.21,246.88,3.6699999999999875,Participant,and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e
247.25,250.6,3.3499999999999943,Participant,so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation
250.98,258.52,7.539999999999992,Participant,figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first
262.685,265.695,3.009999999999991,Participant,i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with
266.11,268.61,2.5,Participant,um i don't really let anything agitate me
269.03,273.29,4.260000000000048,Participant,and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just
273.61,284.01,10.399999999999977,Participant,do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it
284.4,286.1,1.7000000000000455,Participant,be who you are and just stay there
290.73,300.66,9.930000000000007,Participant,actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it
301.03,308.11,7.080000000000041,Participant,and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways
308.425,317.065,8.639999999999986,Participant,and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings
320.26,323.49,3.230000000000018,Participant,when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because
323.865,333.865,10.0,Participant,the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic
334.21,338.84,4.6299999999999955,Participant,and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard
346.4,348.55,2.150000000000034,Participant,hmm <sigh> let's see
349.28,351.96,2.680000000000007,Participant,i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old
352.47,357.1,4.6299999999999955,Participant,and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it
357.45,364.29,6.840000000000032,Participant,he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him
364.67,366.3,1.6299999999999955,Participant,as opposed to waiting him to call me
366.77,367.26,0.4900000000000091,Participant,and i think
367.94,377.03,9.089999999999975,Participant,it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come
377.39,379.35,1.9600000000000364,Participant,and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place
379.75,387.77,8.019999999999982,Participant,but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but
388.215,396.96,8.745000000000005,Participant,i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult
397.355,399.735,2.3799999999999955,Participant,and then also not expected him to just kinda you know
401.06,405.17,4.110000000000014,Participant,i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense
409.54,418.05,8.509999999999991,Participant,woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and
418.96,424.84,5.8799999999999955,Participant,i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so
425.43,428.59,3.159999999999968,Participant,it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally
428.92,429.48,0.5600000000000023,Participant,so
429.78,437.31,7.53000000000003,Participant,my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect
437.735,443.405,5.669999999999959,Participant,so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect
448.64,456.28,7.639999999999986,Participant,seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change
456.63,461.12,4.490000000000009,Participant,but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just
461.48,468.36,6.8799999999999955,Participant,kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that
468.765,475.52,6.7549999999999955,Participant,i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own
475.88,479.74,3.8600000000000136,Participant,and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but
480.13,486.1,5.970000000000027,Participant,whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me
490.51,496.29,5.78000000000003,Participant,it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real
496.72,499.99,3.269999999999982,Participant,it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy
500.44,504.13,3.6899999999999977,Participant,um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own
504.55,509.26,4.7099999999999795,Participant,and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just
509.72,515.38,5.659999999999968,Participant,being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that
521.01,527.24,6.230000000000018,Participant,wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here
527.605,533.245,5.639999999999986,Participant,so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing
533.58,537.78,4.199999999999932,Participant,it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure
538.26,541.14,2.8799999999999955,Participant,uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling
541.5,547.86,6.360000000000014,Participant,but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter
548.18,551.81,3.6299999999999955,Participant,so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent
558.68,565.69,7.010000000000105,Participant,divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me
566.097,570.737,4.639999999999986,Participant,and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore
